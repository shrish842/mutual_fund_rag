## ‚ùì Problem Statement

The Indian mutual fund landscape is vast and complex. Investors and advisors face challenges in:

1. **Information Overload:** Sifting through thousands of funds, AMCs, prospectuses, and news.
2. **Understanding Relationships:** Grasping how funds, sectors, management companies, and macroeconomic factors (like crude oil prices or interest rates) influence each other.
3. **Getting Reliable Answers:** Standard search engines or generic AI often fail to provide accurate, context-aware answers to nuanced, relationship-based questions (e.g., "Which funds managed by AMC X are most sensitive to interest rate changes?").

---

## üí° Our Solution: Graph-Powered RAG

This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system enhanced by a structured **Knowledge Graph** approach (simulated in this Proof of Concept) to address these challenges.

1. **Knowledge Representation:** We model entities (Funds, AMCs, Sectors, Factors) and their crucial relationships (`ManagedBy`, `InvestsIn`, `AffectedBy`) conceptually as a graph. *(In this POC, this graph is simulated using Python dictionaries for rapid development)*.
2. **RAG Pipeline:**
    - **Retrieve:** When a user asks a question, we first query our knowledge base (the simulated graph) to find relevant entities *and* their connections.
    - **Augment:** The factual, structured information retrieved from the graph is formatted into a context snippet.
    - **Generate:** This context, along with the original query, is fed to a powerful Large Language Model (Google Gemini). The LLM is instructed to generate an answer based *only* on the provided factual context.

**The Result:** Answers are grounded in specific data, are more reliable, and can address complex relational queries that generic models struggle with.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features (POC)

- **Basic Intent Recognition:** Identifies user intent (e.g., find fund details, find funds by factor) using keyword matching.
- **Simulated Graph Querying:** Retrieves data and relationship information from the hardcoded Python dictionary structure.
- **Relational Context Building:** Can find funds affected by factors directly or indirectly via sector links.
- **LLM Integration:** Uses Google Gemini API for natural language answer generation.
- **Contextual Answer Generation:** Provides answers based on retrieved knowledge, reducing hallucination.
- **Web Interface:** Simple UI built with Streamlit for interaction and demo purposes.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Replace <your-repo-url> with the actual URL from GitHub
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mutual-fund-rag
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create the environment:
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment:
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root project directory:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE
```

‚úÖ **Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`**

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. **Open in Browser:**  
Visit `http://localhost:8501` (Streamlit will show the URL in the terminal).

4. **Interact with the App:**

Try sample queries like:

- `Tell me about FundC Infrastructure`
- `Which funds are affected by Crude Oil Price?`
- `What funds does AMC_X manage?`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (POC)

- **Simulated Knowledge:** Uses a small, hardcoded dataset.
- **Basic Parsing:** Relies on keyword matching for intent detection.
- **No Real Graph Database:** Uses Python dictionaries (not scalable).
- **Limited Entity Types:** Only Funds, AMCs, Sectors, and Factors modeled.
- **Static:** No real-time updates.

---

## üå± Future Work

- **Real Data Integration:** AMFI, SEBI, financial APIs.
- **Graph Database Backend:** Neo4j, TigerGraph, or AWS Neptune.
- **Advanced NLP/NLU:** spaCy, transformers, or custom LLM fine-tuning.
- **Expanded Schema:** Include fund managers, news articles, stocks, and more.
- **Context Explainability:** Visualize reasoning and graph path.
- **Advanced Tools:** Personalized portfolios, what-if analysis, risk models.
